Contextinator aims to become a practical and reliable tool for agentic tasks that require codebase-level context. Our objective is to build a unified solution that supports embeddings, offline models, efficient vector search, and system-level tools for querying and inspecting code. The project is open to contributors who want to help shape this direction.

We are working toward the following:
* Making the current system more reliable, faster, and structurally better, as the initial versions were built quickly and require refinement.
* Moving from cloud-based embeddings (such as OpenAI embeddings) to offline embedding models that run efficiently on consumer hardware.
* Replacing heavy solutions like ChromaDB with a faster, simpler, hardware-efficient vector database designed specifically for our needs.
* Expanding the tool beyond embeddings by exposing utilities such as grep, folder/file search, and other command-line level capabilities for deeper codebase querying, similar to tools like Claude Code or AWS Q.

These goals require active contribution, discussion, and experimentation. We welcome contributors who want to explore ideas, develop features, improve performance, or help shape the future architecture of the tool.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository.
2. Identify what you want to work on. You may pick an existing issue or open a new one to propose your idea.
3. Ask to be assigned to the issue.
4. Work on the feature or fix in your fork.
5. When finished, open a pull request and request a review from the maintainers.

If the PR aligns with the project direction and passes review, it will be merged.
